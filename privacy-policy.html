            designated confidential by us and that you shall not disclose such information without our prior written
            consent. Your information is regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party,

          <h6 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5">OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS</h6>

          <ol class="text-indent-50">Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only
            addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your
            information to other parties, whether they are on our Platform or other sites throughout the Internet,
            different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent
            that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their privacy policies. Since we do not control the
            privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose your personal
            information to others.</ol>

          <h6 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5">OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h6>

          <ol class="text-indent-50">Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
            private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not
            otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be
            forced to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Therefore,
            although we use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
            expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications would always remain private.
            We do however assure you that any disclosure of your personally identifiable information shall be personally
            intimated to you through an email sent to your provided email address.</ol>

          <ol class="text-indent-50">As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable
            information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your
            personally identifiable information may be disclosed: </ol>

          <ol>a. External Service Providers: There may be several services offered by external service providers that
            help you use our Platform. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so,
            disclose information to the external service providers, and/or permit them to collect information about you,
            then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.</ol>

          <ol>b. Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce
            laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to)
            disclose any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole
            discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual
            property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.</ol>

          <h6 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5">ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h6>

          <ol class="text-indent-50">You can review and change the information you submitted except info@enclaim.in. An
            option for facilitating such change shall be present on the Platform and such change shall be facilitated by
            the User. If you change any information, we may or may not keep track of your old information. We will not
            retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve
            disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be
            completely removed from our databases, including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you believe that any
            information, we are holding on to you is incorrect or incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others
            cannot view it, the User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect information.</ol>
